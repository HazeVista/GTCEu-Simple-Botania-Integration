## GTCEu Simple Botania Integration

Made by the collective AstroGreg Team since Botania was preventing us from doing mixins or setting up proper datagen in our core mod. 

Feel free to use this mod in any project, it just requires Botania, Botanic Additions, and GregTech Molecular Drawings as dependencies.

All it does is add Manasteel, Terrasteel, Elementium, and Gaiasteel as GTCEu Materials with setIgnored.
