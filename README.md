## GTCEu Simple Botania Integration

Made by the collective AstroGreg Team since Botania was preventing us from doing mixins or setting up proper datagen in our core mod. 

Only intended for use in the AstroGreg:Exsilium Modpack but feel free to use any code from here in your own project.

All it does is add Botania and Botanic Additions items as GTCEu Materials with setIgnored.

Original template for this mod created by [screret](https://github.com/screret) and [JuiceyBeans](https://github.com/JuiceyBeans)
